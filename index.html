    <p>Dear Fellow Investor,</p>
    <p>Hello, and thank you for watching our VR video. We enjoyed shooting it and I hope it's got you starting to think about the long-term potential of VR.</p>
    <p>My name is Eric Bleeker and I was the guy on the left side of your screen in that video.</p>
    <p>And since you watched it, you know that I strongly believe the following two points:</p>


    <div class="number__block">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>VR is going to be big. It has the potential to change the world in the same way that smartphones, the Internet, and computers have over the past several decades... and...</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Because of that potential, investors who make the right moves today will make an absolute killing.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>With those two points in mind, if you're anything like me...</p>


    <h3>The question you're probably asking yourself right now is: "How can I make money from it?"</h3>
    <p>I love that question.</p>
    <p>It's like the American Dream boiled down to 7 simple words:</p>
    <p>"How can I make money from it?"</p>
    <p>Well don't worry... you're in the right place.</p>
    <p>We're going to explore the VR investing landscape today and I'm your guide.</p>
    <p>Just spend a few minutes with me here and then you can decide for yourself if you want to try and make some money by investing in VR.</p>
    <p>I'll start by telling you why I think VR is going to be big.</p>
    <p>And then I'll tell you about the 4 companies that I believe will dominate the VR industry over the next few years.</p>
    <p>Now before we start, I'd like to give you a warning:</p>


    <h3>Don't fall into the "Raving Madman" Trap</h3>

    <p>Let me explain.</p>
    <p>It's easy to dismiss new technology as science fiction right before it gets big. Or a fad.</p>
    <p>Think about Microsoft in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Back then, their mission was to have a computer on every desk, in every home.</p>
    <p>To many people, that mission sounded absurd. Nobody would have blamed you for calling Bill Gates a "Raving Madman" for even saying it.</p>
    <p>If you've ever used a 1980s-era computer, you know what I'm talking about. They had useful business applications, but the average Joe? He didn't need one in his house.</p>
    <p>Many people thought Bill Gates sounded crazy. Even some computer industry execs who should have known better.</p>
    <p>Ken Olsen, founder of mainframe computer maker Digital Equipment Corporation , famously said:</p>
    <p class="testimonial__simple ">
      <strong>"There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Ken Olsen.</em>
    </p>
    <p>I bet he still winces when he sees that one. But Ken is in good company.</p>


    <p>History is full of quotes that prove humans are terrible predictors:</p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"A rocket will never be able to leave the Earth's atmosphere."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— New York Times, 1936.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"Flight by machines heavier than air is unpractical (sic) and insignificant, if not utterly impossible."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Simon Newcomb; The Wright Brothers flew at Kittyhawk 18 months later.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible." </strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Lord Kelvin, British mathematician and physicist, president of the British Royal Society, 1895.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"There will never be a bigger plane built."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— A Boeing engineer, after the first flight of the 247, a twin engine plane that holds ten people.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"The horse is here to stay but the automobile is only a novelty - a fad."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— The president of the Michigan Savings Bank advising Henry Ford's lawyer, Horace Rackham, not to invest in the Ford Motor Co., 1903.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"Television won't last. It's a flash in the pan." </strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Mary Somerville, pioneer of radio educational broadcasts, 1948.</em>
    </p>


    <p>If you want to make money as a tech investor, you have to keep these stories in mind. Hang them on the wall in front of your desk.</p>
    <p>Because all of us think we're better predictors than we actually are.</p>
    <p>Your only hope is to lean on evidence. Study it and make informed decisions, rather than listen to your gut.</p>
    <p>And I'm going to make that easy for you. You're about to see some of the best evidence I could dig up.</p>
    <p>I guarantee you... some of the stuff here will sound like science fiction.</p>
    <p>You might even think I sound like a "raving madman."</p>
    <p>But as you'll see, a lot of very smart of people - and I'm going to lay out all the proof - say this stuff is right around the corner.</p>
    <p>And look, it's okay to dismiss VR for now. As long as you're ok with being a bystander. To sit on the sidelines while other people are making money.</p>
    <p>You can dismiss me as a "Raving Madman" -- it's your call.</p>
    <p>But imagine yourself a year from now, reading headlines in your favorite newspaper. VR is smashing all sales expectations. People love it.</p>
    <p>Will you be kicking yourself for not taking this seriously?</p>
    <p>Or will you be bragging to your buddies about how much money you made?</p>
    <p>I know which scenario I prefer. How about you?</p>
    <p>All I'm asking is this: take a critical look at the facts I'm sharing today. Then decide for yourself what to do with the information.</p>
    <p>Because you still have a little time to get in on VR <em>before</em> it really gets going.</p>


    <h3>I'm guessing that you missed your chance to be an early investor in Microsoft back in the 1980s.</h3>
    <p>Or Amazon in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Or even Google in the early 2000s.</p>
    <p>But none of that matters right now.</p>
    <p>I don't care if you're 25, 55, or 85... if you're rich or poor... working or retired... man or woman... college grad or high school dropout.</p>
    <p>One of the great things about the stock market is that <u>your past does not matter.</u></p>
    <p>Even if you've invested in 100 duds in a row, you start every new investment with a clean slate.</p>
    <p>It takes just one big winner to completely change your life. And as you'll soon see, I think this could be the kind of once-in-a-decade opportunity you need to do exactly that.</p>
    <p>Let's jump in and find out...</p>


    <h3>Why everybody from Wall Street to Silicon Valley is predicting a Virtual Reality Revolution</h3>

    <p>If I had to guess, I'd say the video you watched today wasn't the first time you've heard about a virtual reality revolution.</p>
    <p>It's already starting to pop up in some of the savvier media publications.</p>
    <p>And some Wall Street insiders, including Goldman Sachs, are having back-channel conversation about the huge potential of VR.</p>
    <p>Just take a look at this excerpt from an obscure Goldman Sachs report that I found:</p>
    <p class="testimonial__simple">"There's no shortage of examples of how VR can reshape existing ways of doing things - from buying a new home, interacting with a doctor, or watching a football game.... We believe VR has the potential to spawn a multibillion-dollar industry, and
      possibly be as game changing as the advent of the PC."</p>
    <p>Take a close look at that last part:</p>
    <p><strong>Has the potential to spawn a multibillion-dollar industry, and possibly be as game changing as the advent of the PC...</strong></p>
    <p>You can be sure Goldman doesn't throw predictions like that around lightly. Their reputation is on the line.</p>


    <div class="row">
      <h3>Now I have to admit that I was skeptical going into this project.</h3>

      <div class="col-sm-7">
        <p>After all, people have been talking about virtual reality for decades, and the technology never lived up the hype.</p>
        <p>But what most skeptics don't get is the "3 Building Block" explanation for why now is the time for VR to emerge.</p>
        <p>Let me show you something.</p>
        <p>Check out the images on the right.</p>
        <p>The images are from a game franchise called Wolfenstein.</p>
        <p>The first is from a version of the game that came out in 1993 and the second in 2015.</p>
        <p>Can you imagine a "virtual reality" experience using those 1993-quality graphics? Me either.</p>
        <p>That's one of three big reasons past attempts failed. The other two are just as important, and they've been fixed as well. More on that later.</p>
        <p>For the time being, let me just tell you this, as a former skeptic: modern VR technology is completely mind-blowing.</p>
        <p>Just take my word for it. Or find a place to demo it yourself.</p>
        <p>Because no article can prepare you for the experience.</p>
        <p>This technology transports you to a different place and it tricks your brain into thinking you're really there.</p>
        <p>It's unlike anything you've ever experienced, and I'm convinced that virtual reality is going to spread across America like wildfire.</p>
        <p>Now, I'd like to tell you that I'm the first person to figure this out. But I'm not.</p>
        <p>In fact...</p>

    <h3>Industry Experts Predict The Virtual Reality Market Could Reach $182 Billion Within the Decade</h3>

    <p>Which is good to know. Because before you ever make an investment, you should try to figure out how big the opportunity is. That $182 billion prediction comes from the same obscure Goldman Sachs report I mentioned earlier.</p>
    <p>All signs seem to say that VR is going to spread far and wide, which is why Goldman felt confident enough to put out such a large prediction for the market size.</p>
    <p>Of course, it would be nice to know beyond a doubt that VR is going to be successful, but there's always a little bit of uncertainty when it comes to new technology.</p>
    <p>So you might be tempted to hold-off on making any investments until you know for sure that VR is selling well.</p>
    <p>But if you've been around the block a few times, you know that's a risky game to play. Because timing your investment in emerging technologies is a tricky business.</p>
    <p>Like we've seen so many times before once a trend takes hold, the stocks behind the trend can takeoff like a rocket ship. Which means the big money is made by investors who got in before it was a 100% sure-thing.</p>
    <p>So the important question that you and I have to answer is...</p>
    <p><strong>"Will virtual reality be the next big thing?"</strong></p>
    <p>And if it is, what stocks should we buy to invest in it?</p>
    <p>Let's start by looking at a couple quotes from both business and finance perspectives.</p>
    <p>The business perspective is from Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook. In January 2014, after trying a prototype of modern VR goggles for the first time, he described his experience as, quote:</p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"One of the coolest things I've ever seen."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook.</em>
    </p>

    <p>And keep in mind, the device he used was an early prototype. The consumer-grade gear that's coming to the market this year is far better than what he tried in 2014.</p>
    <p>And as a sign of how incredible his experience was, he didn't stop there. He's young, but he's a man of action and he put his money where his mouth is.</p>
    <p>He invested $2 billion of Facebook's own money in the company that made the prototype he used.</p>
    <p>And as the CEO of Facebook, with access to all of the data generated by Facebook's 1.6 billion members, he's in a good position to know what people are excited about.</p>
    <p>Now, you may not have $2 billion lying around, but you don't need it. The stocks I recommend in my VR investing playbook are all publicly traded companies, so you can invest as little, or as much as you'd like.</p>
    <p>Let's move on and look to the finance world and see what Wall Street has to say about virtual reality.</p>
    <p>Starting with that report from Goldman Sachs I mentioned. I expected them to be conservative since they're an old-guard Wall Street firm, so I was surprised when I read that quote you saw earlier. The one that said:</p>

    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"Virtual Reality has the potential to spawn a multibillion-dollar industry, and possibly be as game changing as the advent of the PC."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Goldman Sachs.</em>
    </p>

    <p>They go on to predict that the value of the virtual reality market could reach $182 billion within 10 years and will have many applications outside of video games.</p>
    <p>On the topic of potential, they had this to say:</p>
    <p class="testimonial__simple">"Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have the potential to become the next big computing platform, and as we saw with the PC and smartphone, we expect new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted."</p>
    <p>And taking a closer look at Goldman's $182 billion market size prediction, it's a combination of hardware and software sales: $110 billion for hardware and $72 billion for software.</p>
    <p>So right there we have a cornerstone for our VR investing playbook: include both hardware and software plays.</p>
    <p>Because in any game, you want to give yourself as many chances to win as you can.</p>
    <p>So my plan of attack includes 4 companies to invest in that'll give you exposure to both sides ... hardware and software... in a couple of ways.</p>
    <p>More on that in a bit.</p>
    <p>I think this is a good time to take a step back and look at one of the key points here.</p>
    <p>For VR to reach its potential, it has to find an audience beyond just the hardcore gamers.</p>
    <p>So let's take a look at the areas outside of gaming that VR is expected to make a big impact.</p>
    <p>And as it turns out...</p>


    <h3>Analysts say that 9 industries are ripe for disruption by VR.</h3>
    <p>Let's run through the list so you can get a sense for the breadth of VR's potential early applications.</p>

    <!--
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Video Games:</u></strong> This is the obvious one - everybody expects that gamers will be the early adopters for virtual reality, so I don't think this one needs much explanation.</li>
<li><strong><u>Live Events:</u></strong> The NBA has already started placing special VR cameras courtside at their games. Imagine the ability to instantly sit in the best seats at sporting events without leaving your house. Or, still sitting in your house, while your favorite band is in China, you jump in and watch their concert live, as if you were there.</li>
<li><strong><u>Video Entertainment:</u></strong> Just imagine watching your favorite movie, but rather than watching it from a seat in your living room, you were witnessing the action as one of the characters, fully immersed in the action.</li>
<li><strong><u>Health Care:</u></strong> I think this will be huge for elderly people. Doctors can see their patients "face-to-face" in virtual rooms, with no travel.</li>
<li><strong><u>Real Estate:</u></strong> Anybody who's bought a house can tell you that home shopping is a pain. It takes so much time to visit home after home. Imagine being able to tour any house on the market at any time you want, again, without leaving your house. I think VR will be a game-changer here.</li>
<li><strong><u>Retail:</u></strong> You know, frankly I'm dubious about this one, but some analysts think VR will have a big impact on retail because customers can examine products as if they were actually in their hands. We'll see.</li>
<li><strong><u>Education:</u></strong> Internet education is already a big trend. Online classes like the Khan Academy have been revolutionary, and virtual reality will take that to a whole new level by recreating the in-person classroom experience that's currently missing from Internet classrooms.</li>
<li><strong><u>Engineering:</u></strong> Product design will be a lot easier, cheaper, and faster when engineers can test their ideas in a virtual environment without ever building a physical prototype.</li>
<li><strong><u>Military:</u></strong> Training exercises will be for more effective and safe when accurate virtual simulations are available. And with the government as a customer, you know it has big-money potential.</li>
</ul>

    <p>One application I'm personally excited about is virtual tourism. I cannot wait until fully immersive simulations of cities are available.</p>
    <p>I've never been to Rome, but I would love to go.</p>
    <p>How cool would it be to load a simulation of a city like Rome and feel like you're actually walking the streets?</p>
    <p>That might sounds incredible if you haven't tried modern VR yet, but I don't think it's that far off.</p>
    <p>I'd say that in 2016 we'll see at least one major headline about a non-video game breakthrough application of VR. Probably more. And I think in 2017 we'll see a constant stream VR headlines.</p>
    <p>And it's here that we reach a critical juncture...</p>

    <h3>So I'd like to ask you two questions about your future before we move on.</h3>


    <div class="number__block">
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Can we agree that VR has the potential to be a massive success?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If VR does take off, would YOU like to be one of the people raking in profits while it sweeps the nation?</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <p>If you answered 'Yes' to both of those questions, I think you'll want to pay close attention to the rest of this message.</p>
    <p>Because as I've mentioned a couple of times in the past few minutes, I have an investing plan that I think is going to payoff big over the next few years.</p>
    <p>And here's where I need to make a confession, because...</p>
    <p>I think it's generally a bad idea to take investing advice from random pages on the Internet.</p>
    <p>But of course, I feel very strongly that the investing recommendations that I'm about to give you are good.</p>
    <p>There's my dilemma.</p>
    <p>So how about this... before I give you my stock picks for investing in virtual reality, let me tell you more about The Motley Fool and our track record.</p>
    <p>That way you can decide for yourself if we're worth listening to.</p>
    <p>The first thing I like to tell people about our track record is that...</p>

    <p><em>Stock Advisor</em> is our flagship investing service, and in case you've never heard of it, let me tell you why you should care.</p>
    <p>If you've ever shopped around for mutual funds or for an investment advisor, you know that they like to compare their performance to the S&P 500.</p>
    <p>Now, most funds actually lose to the S&P 500, so it's a big bragging right for them if they can say they've beaten it by 5% or 10%.</p>
    <p>But we've done so much better than the S&P 500 that it's kind of gaudy:</p>
    <p><em>Stock Advisor</em>'s returns have crushed the stock market by nearly 3X: XXX% vs YY%.</p>
    <p>And bear in mind, that's not a fluke - those numbers cover 14 years and include every stock ever recommended, including winners and losers.</p>
    <p>How is that possible?</p>
    <p>Well, <em>Stock Advisor</em> has a long history of identifying huge trends before they hit big AND recommending the right investments in life-changing companies that benefit from those trends. Companies like:</p>

    <p>The explosion of online-traveling booking -- recommending <strong>Priceline Group (PCLN)</strong> - Up <span class="green">5,380%</span> since 2004.</p>
    <p>The breakthrough advances in ecommerce -- recommending <strong>Amazon.com (AMZN)</strong> - Up <span class="green">3,548%</span> since 2002.</p>
    <p>And even the "out of nowhere" popularity of streaming videos and movies - recommending that investors buy shares <strong>Netflix (NFLX)</strong> all the way back in in 2004 - Now up <span class="green">4,069%.</span></p>
    <p>Add it all up, and investors who invested just $1,000 in each of those recommendations would be sitting on more than $140,000 today!</p>
    <p>But you don't have to take my word for it.</p>


    <h3>The Wall Street Journal reported <em>Stock Advisor</em> as being among the very best-performing stock-picking systems in the world.</h3>
    <p>That's right. In 2013, The Wall Street Journal's Hulbert review conducted a thorough review of over 200 different trading systems.</p>
    <p>They evaluated each system on its actual results over a 5-year period, from 2008 to 2013, a period that included both the stock market crash and the recovery that followed.</p>
    <p>And we're proud to say that after combing through all of the data, they placed <em>Stock Advisor</em> in the top 3 of all the systems the evaluated.</p>


    <h3>Now, I know that investment decisions can be nerve-wracking.</h3>
    <p>Especially since it often feels like the financial game is rigged against us.</p>
    <p>But the rewards of investing in an emerging technology right before it takes off can be massive. Take one look at the returns in that list above and you can see it's true.</p>
    <p>If you're ready to finally take control of your financial life... and put yourself in a position to make some big money... I encourage you to read the rest of this page carefully.</p>
    <p>I'm going to layout the rest of the reasoning for why we think virtual reality is going to be huge.</p>
    <p>Let's start by diving deeper into the case for virtual reality.</p>
    <p>If you're anything like me, you may wonder why now is the time for virtual reality to take off. After all, people have been using some form of this technology for years. Decades, even.</p>
    <p>It's a great question... every great investor I've ever met asks those kinds of hard-hitting skeptical questions.</p>
    <p>And to answer it, you need to know...</p>


    <h3>The 3 Building Blocks Powering the VR Boom</h3>
    <p>The idea of virtual reality has always excited people. Put on some goggles and escape to anywhere... experience anything... instantly and on a whim.</p>
    <p>But until recently, the grand visions of virtual reality's promise were unobtainable because the technology wasn't powerful enough.</p>
    <p>Anybody who tried virtual reality devices in the 80's and 90's knows just how disappointing those early efforts were.</p>
    <p>So what has changed?</p>
    <p>Well, over the past decade, the 3 critical building blocks required to make VR work improved exponentially. Let's take a look...</p>

              <p class="title">Building Block #1:</p>
              <p class="description">Computers Are 1,793 Times Faster</p>
              <p>For virtual reality to work well, the experience needs to feel real. It needs to be absolutely convincing. An experience like that requires a lot of computing power, and 1990's-era computers weren't up to the challenge.</p>
              <p>Consider Intel's first Pentium chip. Released in 1993 and packing over 3.1 million transistors, it was a revolutionary improvement for consumer PCs.</p>
              <p>But it looks ancient compared to Intel's latest chip. It's called "Haswell" and it has a truly shocking number of transistors: <u>5.56 BILLION</u>.</p>
              <p>That's 1,793 times more processing power than 1993's state-of-the-art Pentium computer chip.</p>

              <p class="description">Screens Are 20 Times More Clear</p>
              <p>Think back to the TV you had in the 1990's. Try and remember how fuzzy the picture was. Now compare that to the incredible HD image quality we get at home today.</p>
              <p>Fact is, attempts to create compelling VR experiences in the 80's and 90's never had a chance. Even if the computers had been fast enough, the screens weren't up-to-snuff.</p>

              <p class="description">Graphics Are “Night and Day” Better</p>
              <p>Take a look at the screenshots below and you can immediately see how much graphics have improved since the 1990's.</p>
              <p>The images are from a game franchise called Wolfenstein. The first is from a version of the game that came out in 1993 and the second in 2015.</p>
              <p>Modern computer graphics have improved so much that it can be difficult to distinguish them from real video footage. These hyper-realistic graphics were the final factor needed to make truly immersive virtual reality experiences possible.</p>
              <img class="image__well" src="http://g.foolcdn.com/mms/media/mce_filebrowser/2016/04/21/wolf_ZYjwI5B.png" alt="" />
              <p>Faster computers. Better screens. Amazing graphics.</p>
              <p>Great VR experiences are only possible because all three of those technological improvements are happening at the same time.</p>
              <p>And while it may seem like a great coincidence that all three are coming together at the same time, it's really a result of the intense competition among smartphone manufacturers.</p>
              <p>Companies like Apple and Samsung have faced continual pressure to release faster phones, with screens that have sharper resolutions, and better games.</p>
              <p>That pressure forced mobile-device manufacturers to pour billions of dollars into research and development to meet ever-increasing customer demands.</p>
              <p>I don't think it was on anybody's radar at the time, but all those improvements for smartphones had far-ranging implications for the nearly forgotten field of virtual reality.</p>
              <p>And it set the stage for the 4 companies that we think are going to make a lot of money when next-generation VR devices hit stores this year.</p>
              <p>At this point you should have a pretty good sense for why we think VR is going to be a big deal.</p>
              <p>So without further ado, let's take a look at...</p>

      </div>

    <h3>The 4 Stocks We Believe Are Poised To Dominate The Virtual Reality Market</h3>


    <h4><strong><u>Stock #1</u></strong></h4>
    <p>Just moments ago I noted the fantastic advances in screen clarity since the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the companies announcing major VR plans this year. From Sony, to Facebook, to Samsung, they're all relying on one specific kind of screen technology. It's known as organic light-emitting diodes, or OLED. And since it is a critical component
      of all the major VR devices, there's a tremendously lucrative path to cashing in on the emergence of VR.</p>
    <p>The key piece of information for investors is that there's a single company that has managed to accumulate a huge treasure trove of patents that pay it a "toll" as OLED use explodes.</p>

    <img class="pull-right img-responsive" style="max-height: 300px" src="http://g.foolcdn.com/mms/media/mce_filebrowser/2016/04/22/chart.png" alt="">


    <p>And this patent explosion is already turning into sales. This company's revenues have soared 526% in the past five years.</p>
    <p>And remember, all that revenue growth has come before the virtual reality even took off...</p>
    <p>Leaving a huge amount of opportunity ahead for this company, because the adoption of VR will create a great deal of demand for OLED screens.</p>

    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    <h4><strong><u>Stock #2</u></strong></h4>

    <p>Another building block powering the VR boom is the speed of modern computers.</p>
    <p>Virtual reality is all about delivering vivid, life-like experiences. Which take some serious computing power to create. In fact, those top of the line VR experiences require <strong>7X the power</strong> of most normal video games today.</p>
    <p>One company specializes in the unique processor technology needed to power VR systems.</p>
    <p>No, it's not Intel.</p>
    <p>In fact, Intel had to pay this company an astonishing <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> just to license the patents of its incredible technology! In total, company #2 counts more than 7,000 patents issued and pending, and spends more than $1.3 billion
      every year on R&D to extend its lead over the competition.</p>
    <p>Even with VR just getting started this year, company #2 stands to potentially make several hundred million on VR technology already this year. Looking forward just a few years to the end of the decade, that figure could swell nearly <strong>8X</strong>      to more than $2.2 billion in a single year!</p>

    <h4><strong><u>Stock #3</u></strong></h4>
    <p>Let's look again at one of the Goldman Sachs quotes about how VR was poised to "become the next big computing platform, and as we saw with the PC and smartphone, we expect new markets to be created and existing markets to be disrupted."</p>
    <p>Thinking back in time, the most "sure bet" for PCs was <strong>Microsoft</strong>, the company that built the software platform for hundreds of millions of computers.</p>
    <p>For smartphones, I trust you'd say the "sure bet" was <strong>Apple</strong>, a company that controlled software and made a king's ransom collecting a fee from everything sold on its wildly profitable App Store.</p>
    <p>Company #3 is the company I've identified as the most likely "sure bet" for the next computing platform. It's already an incredible company, having seen sales skyrocket 808% in the past five years...</p>
    <p>This is one company we believe you can't afford to miss out on.</p>

    <h4><strong><u>Stock #4</u></strong></h4>
    <p>Virtual reality will eventually transform markets from live events, to health care, to real estate. Yet, in the coming years, its largest impact will be felt on video games.</p>
    <p>Goldman Sachs believes the video game market hit $106 billion in sales last year and will continue to surge ahead. Within a decade, it projects an astonishing 216 million people will be playing games in VR!</p>
    <p>So for my fourth investment, I'm honing in on the video game producer that I believe will make some of the most popular VR games.</p>
    <p>That shift of VR making video games bigger than ever is an enormous opportunity for Company #4. It sits on a murderer's row of franchises, the most successful of which can generate $500 million in sales in a single day.</p>

    <h3>Don't Sit On Your Hands While Virtual Reality Changes The World As We Know It</h3>

    <p>If you'd like to make a lot of money in the stock market, then you owe it to yourself and your family to take action today and check out these stocks before it's too late.</p>
    <p>Because, as you've probably seen a hundred times before, high tech growth stocks can move fast.</p>
    <p>By this time next year, I think you'll see a bunch of headlines about the power of virtual reality.</p>
    <p>Stories about how some investors are making a killing.</p>
    <p>And about Silicon Valley entrepreneurs barely out of puberty who made hundreds of millions of dollars over night.</p>
    <p>Now imagine if this time... unlike the computer, Internet, and smartphone revolutions... you had the foresight to become an investor yourself.</p>
    <p>Imagine shocking your friends and family when you tell them that you were an early investor in the companies being touted by the press.</p>


    <h3>THIS is your chance to get in on what may be the most powerful investing secret in finance</h3>
    <p><em>Motley Fool <em>Stock Advisor</em></em> was designed from the ground up for regular people like you and me.</p>
    <p>People with families, day jobs, and active lives outside of their stock portfolios.</p>
    <p>You've already seen a handful of examples showing that <em>Stock Advisor</em> has delivered amazing profits for more than a decade.</p>
    <p>And you've seen that the <em>Stock Advisor</em> has more than TRIPLED the stock market's return since it launched:</p>
    <p><em>Stock Advisor</em>'s return: 186.2%</p>
    <p>S&P 500's return: 54.8%</p>
    <img class="pull-right img-responsive" style="max-height: 300px" src="https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T024FSPSL-F147UUYER/pasted_image_at_2016_04_27_12_15_pm.png">

    <p>And that those profits weren't just based on one hot stock pick or taking huge risks. This chart shows that <em>Stock Advisor</em> has steadily and consistently beaten the market:</p>
    <p>And if that's not proof enough for you, don't forget that The Wall Street Journal reported <em>Stock Advisor</em> as being among the very best-performing stock-picking systems in the world.</p>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    <h3>It's time to take the first step toward your new financial life.</h3>

    <p>It's simply a matter of pulling the trigger and getting started.</p>
    <p>But "getting started" is where many people stumble.</p>
    <p>And look, there will never be a "perfect" moment to start. There's always going to be something happening in your life. Something to excuse putting it off until next week... next month... next year...</p>
    <p>It's so easy to fall into the trap of those excuses.</p>
    <p>So let me assure you of two things:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>This is an incredible time to start investing with the <em>Stock Advisor</em>. Virtual reality promises to change the world as we know it and my investment guide is hot off the presses. If you'd like to ride that wave along with us, then you're
          just a few clicks away.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p> Following this system is easy.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The <em>Stock Advisor</em> system doesn't try to "time the market." It won't have you jumping in and out of stocks. You won't be married to your computer while you anxiously wait for urgent "SELL, SELL, SELL!" notifications.</p>
    <p>In fact, you can follow <em>Stock Advisor</em> in as little as 8 minutes per month.</p>
    <p>If you've bought stocks before, you know it's easy. If you haven't, trust me when I say it's about as easy as buying something on Amazon.com.</p>
    <p>And if you're nervous about getting started, don't worry! The <em>Stock Advisor</em> team is available to hold your hand through it all.</p>
    <p>In fact, some of our favorite success stories are from people who weren't sure they could manage their own money. People like Michael and Danny:</p>


    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"Bought 3x as much house... I managed a small brokerage account for my parents. Dad was changing jobs to a position that required him to buy a house... Thanks to the appreciation in Marvel, they were able to buy 3x as much house - free and clear - as initially budgeted."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Michael M., Windermere, Florida</em>
    </p>


    <p class="testimonial">
      <strong>"Paid off a hundred times over... I always read The Motley Fool website, but to be honest I almost didn't buy the newsletter. At the time I had maybe $250 to invest. I am so glad I did because my subscription price has been paid off a hundred times over."</strong>
      <br>
      <em>— Danny V., Longmont, Colorado</em>
    </p>


    <h3>The Wall Street Journal isn't the only organization to notice what Tom and David have been up to.</h3>

    <p class="highlight">[Run pictures of DG and TG on covers, on TV, etc., down a sidebar.]</p>

    <p>From speaking with Larry King on CNBC to talking with Dr. Phil or even appearing on the cover of Fortune magazine...</p>
    <p>David and Tom Gardner have helped investors like you find fortune-making stock picks for over two decades.</p>
    <p>That's why The Economist called The Motley Fool "an ethical oasis" in the financial industry.</p>
    <p>It's why David and Tom have been called before Congress... not once, but twice... to testify on the rights of individual investors.</p>
    <p>It's why Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the SEC, stopped by Fool Global Headquarters to personally say The Motley Fool is "as close to being an effective investor advocate as any organization in America."</p>
    <p>And it's why you should be chomping at the bit to claim your share of the profits coming from <em>Stock Advisor</em>'s latest project!</p>
    <p>That project is, of course, the virtual reality investing guide I've been telling you about today.</p>

    <p>Financial advisors, 401(k)s, and mutual funds can easily cost you thousands upon thousands of dollars per year. Those high fees make financial services the largest investing expense for many people (by far).</p>
    <p>Knowing that, you're probably wondering how much it costs to join <em>Motley Fool <em>Stock Advisor</em></em>. After all, many people would gladly pay $5,000 per year or more for the kinds of returns <em>Stock Advisor</em> has delivered, because their
      extra PROFITS would easily cover the fee.</p>
    <p>So I have to ask, how much would you be willing to pay for advice that has tripled the market's performance?</p>
    <p>How much would that kind of profit-making potential be worth to you?</p>
    <p>Now, I'm happy to say that joining <em>Stock Advisor</em> today won't cost you anywhere near $5,000.</p>
    <p>Because The Motley Fool's mission is to help the world invest better. Not just the already-rich one-percenters.</p>
    <p>It's with that mission clearly in mind that we set our normal price at just $199 per year to join <em>Stock Advisor</em>.</p>
    <p>And given the kind of results you've seen today, I'm sure you'll agree that price is a great deal.</p>
    <p>Especially when you compare it to the fees charged for traditional financial services.</p>
    <p>Now... we think $199 per year is already an unbelievably good deal. But since Tom and David are so confident in the future of virtual reality, they want to make it even easier for you to join <em>Stock Advisor</em> today.</p>
    <p>So they've given me the green light to offer you an even better deal... one that allows you to lock in our best price ever.</p>
